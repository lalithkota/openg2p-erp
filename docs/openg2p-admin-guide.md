## Glossary

    * *Program Enrollment start date* describes the date on which the *beneficiary* started receiving the benefit under the given *program*.

* `Administrator` or `admin` is also a *user* who has access to all the apps and settings on OpenG2P. Additionally, the admin also has access to all the organizations, users, programs, beneficiaries, and program enrollments.
* `Identification`- is an object in OpenG2P which is associated with a beneficiary. A beneficiary could be identified by multiple such IDs- passport, Tax ID, etc.
